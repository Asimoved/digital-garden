The conversation with a friend, or this page will not crash if I make a semantic (meaning) or syntax (grammatical) error. Still, a lot can be learned by reading the dictionary entry of a word.

The list here will have the TLDR version with more details in the full articles.Doubts, Issues <br>Even though I read up on it and have the page <a data-href=\"technique vs. method\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">technique vs. method</a>, I am still debating whether to call these methods or techniques, but for now I do not want to get bogged down. I will just dump everything here and specify, disambiguate later as needed. It's probably okay to call these methods, because the specific implementations will be the different techniques. I am listing, documenting these methods and techniques here to serve as reference and as a growing framework for thinking and analysis to progress the ideas.I plan to organize and categorize these and perhaps even build a few sequential lists (like the one below) that have a flow.As a first, self recursive guiding method let's have:\n<br><a data-href=\"Keep in mind, check and develop the guiding methods you have\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Keep in mind, check and develop the guiding methods you have</a>\nWe have used words, English words to articulate, note and document this first guiding principle. If the words make sense to you, good, it means we made an intelligible sentence. Words and writing are a very very powerful tool.\n<br><a data-href=\"Inspect your base assumptions\" href=\"guides/guiding-methods/inspect-your-base-assumptions.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Inspect your base assumptions</a>\n<br>We are not starting everything from 0, all the time. Whatever we do, whenever we communicate we make a number (innumerable) assumptions. This has an important function to keep things efficient, but there can be disadvantages, and in this case serious ones. But what exactly does the word, <a data-href=\"assumption\" href=\"dictionary/words/assumption.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">assumption</a> mean?\n<br><a data-href=\"Study the meaning of the words\" href=\"guides/guiding-methods/study-the-meaning-of-the-words.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Study the meaning of the words</a>\nA lot can be learned by reading the dictionary entry of a word. The Contexts it is used in, it's Relateds, Synonyms, etc., it's Etymology (origin) can reveal new aspects and insights that will make thinking and documentation more effective and precise.\n<br><a data-href=\"Make the methods actionable\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Make the methods actionable</a>\nThey are useful as text, but they will come alive as code. To keep in mind the guiding principles, methods, set up reminders and other mechanisms, make them as built in, integrated as possible.Of course this has to be elaborated much more to become robust. But let's start by defining some words that we have used so far.<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Dictionary/words/index\" data-href=\"Dictionary/words/index\" href=\"dictionary/words/index.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">index</a><br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Dictionary/words/welcome\" data-href=\"Dictionary/words/welcome\" href=\"dictionary/words/welcome.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">welcome</a><br>\n<a data-href=\"guide\" href=\"dictionary/words/guide.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">guide</a><br>\n<a data-href=\"assume\" href=\"dictionary/words/assume.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">assume</a><br>\n<a data-href=\"assumption\" href=\"dictionary/words/assumption.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">assumption</a>\n<br>15 Properties: For any concept, try to feel which of the 15 properties is close to it. For example, I might say, that the <a data-href=\"Pattern Break\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Pattern Break</a> is Roughness.\nAcceptance: Accept that you don't know what this is, you do not know the shape of the 'problem' and maybe you never will\n♿ Accessibility: How accessible is the thing? It is no use, if it is not, or very difficult to access.\n✨ Actionable: think about and implement things as code, action, etc. so they are not dead and static, but alive, dynamic and part of the stream and fabric of Life.\nAnalysis, Elements: Keep track of that are the element, constituents of the systems at play, in use, and see what kinds of fields they generate. For example the words, sentences in text, the colors of an image, etc.\n🧰 Arsenal, use it fully: use all the tools, elements, etc. available to you. For examples all symbols, Unicode, Emojis, components, Colors, Sketches, plugins, etc.\nAsimov: be as clear and precise as possible. It is not easy, and people underestimate this.\nBase Assumptions: take a step back, zoom out, be honest and try to articulate what your base assumptions are\n🥾 Bootstrapping: Is this the same as Self Recursion?\n🏄 Browsing, surfing freely: kind of like the Catalogue example.\n📔 Catalogue, menu, read it: Sometimes it helps just to browse the whole thing, look at all the items, for later reference and random ideas connections, without looking specifically for anything.\nChange of Scenery, Environment\n📋 Checklists: While usually very dry, this a very basic and powerful technique and can be combined with many other.\nCompare Entities: <br>For example to properly name and categorize, besides the <a data-href=\"Dictionary definition\" href=\"guides/guiding-methods/dictionary-definition.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dictionary definition</a> method, also compare the words and terms. for example: <a data-href=\"technique vs. method\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">technique vs. method</a> 🌐 Consilience: everything should be connected and the traversal should be natural\nContinuous Improvement\n🔣 Creative language, symbols: just like how locals and natives name different plants and animals based on some traits, so that the names themselves contain these traits, we should not be afraid to invent words, language to define specific Centers, Concepts in order to build new tools for thinking, and to avoid the confusion (conflation?) with existing concepts in the mental landscape/mindscape.\n📖 Dictionary Definition: Study the meaning, origin, etymology and relateds of words you use.\n⁉️ Doubt, Question, Skepticism: it does not cost you anything to ask questions, have doubts and take skeptical positions.\nEnvironment: inspirational (books, things), comfort, relaxed?, lighting, which room, nature, peace, quiet, no possibility for interruption\nExamples: Always provide examples, especially for abstractions, abstract descriptions. It can be really painful when there is an elaborate description, but even just one well placed example could illuminate\nFree Association: aka Braindump, just release your train of thought.\nGuiding Methods: List the methods that are most relevant to you.\nGuiding Principles: contemplate what foundations motivate you\nHolistic approach: not only the product is important but all aspects around it in all dimensions and directions (like this list itself)\n🕉️ Icons, Symbols: If you really had to pick, what icon or symbol best represents the thing.\n🥢 Itadakimasu: Japanese be thankful, grateful for the resources, food, energy you use, consume, which passes through you, keeps you alive\n🚙 Journey over Destination: there is nothing wrong with getting to the destination, but make sure it does not damage the experience of getting there.\nKanban: Japanese 🗿 Landmarks, Monuments (Strong Centers): There have to be places, entities that stand out, and around which other entitles are organized. The ASCII Shadow section markers I place in source code, so I can see them on the minimap for better navigation and breakdown. Learn from History: at least learn that we don't learn from it!\n🗃️ Levels of scale, stepwise elaboration, : all representations should be gradual, zooming in-out should be natural (like this point itself) Rule of 3: three levels of scale next to each other Icon (Emoji), Title, Description\n3 levels of indenting (max) 🌀 Lifecycle: everything has a lifecycle, so it is a common pattern that can help with analyzing, understanding, learning\n🎓 Literacy: What level of literacy is needed to understand the thing? How accessible is it?\n🛠️ Manage the Methods: I don't like the word 'manage', but it best encapsulates the creation, maintenance, cleanup, etc. add new methods when you do something that is not on this list if there is any chance that it is not a one off thing (and even then it might be valuable) 🗺️ Maps: Provide a map whenever possible. It is great for navigation, overview and also provides a level of psychological comfort by knowing where you are, where can you go and how to get there.\nMeditation: calm, compose yourself, re-center\nMetaphors: Metaphors are a formidable structure and a powerful tool for discovering patterns, connect ideas, and ferry existing insights across domains. Mindset: should try to achieve, strive for the appropriate mindset that best first your current activity, creative, production, inspiration\nMind your Balance\n🔰 Minimalism: be conservative with space and energy (for ease of maintenance, storage, access, complexity, utility)\nMottainai: Japanese 🎦 Multi-media, multi-view: why not provide all functions, views, representations for everything? Video, Text, Transcript, Audio, Presentation, etc. Natural abilities: Tap into the natural abilities of the Person\n🍅 Nutrition: use different states of nutrition (hunger and fasting are not bad)\nOrganization: better organized, for easier access, manipulation, transformation, communication, storage, backup\nOrigin: study the origin and etymology of things, words, names, concepts, people, etc.\n🔀 Pattern Break: Mix it up sometimes\n🤔 Personal Experiences and Examples: It is easy to get carried away with abstractions that while interesting, are distant from you. See if you have personal experiences and examples that can connect you and ground the concept.\n💾 Preservation: constant backup, preservation, conservation\nPros and Cons:\n🃏 Random: take a chance sometimes, random page, random note, etc.\n🗺️ Relativity: Many things are only knowable in relation to other things. For example: Where are you? You can say a name or other identifier, but if the other party is not familiar, you will have to explain in terms of other places.\n👓 Review: the relation of everything to everything Rewatch, re-read, etc. periodically, you might learn, find something new, see things in a new, different, better light 📍 Save for later: Keep things that you do not understand yet, but feel, have an intuition that will be important or valuable, and might come back to in the future\n<br>♻️ Self-Recursion, Self Reference: Check if self recursion is in any way applicable to what you are doing. For example check the definition of the word: <a data-href=\"word\" href=\"dictionary/words/word.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">word</a> What other examples and sub-methods, sub-techniques? learning about learning\nnotes about notes\ntrash the trashcan\nthinking about thinking The possibilities are almost endless\nAnother example is when the LLMs were made to reflect on their own thinking, which supposedly improved their performance. 💤 Subconscious: let your mind work on it in the background while you use your consciousness, focus and attention for more immediate matters\n🌄 Survey the surrounding Environment: You will have more confidence if you not only know your immediate, but also your surrounding environment. For example know the synonyms of a word, related fields in a discipline, or literally, what neighbors a physical location.\n🔭 Switch points of view, perspectives: try as many as you can, contemplate and compare them, understand the differences\n<br>❓ <a data-href=\"The 5 W's and 1H\" href=\"guides/guiding-methods/the-5-w's-and-1h.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The 5 W's and 1H</a>: Who, What, Where, When, Why? How?\nTry different structures: cyclical, linear, tree, branching, networked\nUnfolding: everything should be foldable stepwise, in a natural beautiful way (like Origami), from one point, to complete multidimensional, explorable space\n🎨 Use Colors\nUse Language\n📟 Use your circumstances: lean into your gifts, abilities, genetics, knowledge, power, wealth, etc.\n🔀 Version control: know where you left off, see the evolution, try forks\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#Collection","#analysis","#current","#seedling","#Site"],"headers":[{"heading":"Content","level":1,"id":"Content_0"},{"heading":"Guiding Methods","level":2,"id":"Guiding_Methods_0"},{"heading":"Methods Index","level":2,"id":"Methods_Index_0"},{"heading":"End of the page","level":1,"id":"End_of_the_page_0"}],"links":["dictionary/words/method.html",".html",".html","guides/guiding-methods/inspect-your-base-assumptions.html","dictionary/words/assumption.html","guides/guiding-methods/study-the-meaning-of-the-words.html",".html","dictionary/words/index.html","dictionary/words/welcome.html","dictionary/words/guide.html","dictionary/words/assume.html","dictionary/words/assumption.html",".html","guides/guiding-methods/dictionary-definition.html",".html","dictionary/words/word.html","guides/guiding-methods/the-5-w's-and-1h.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"guides/guiding-methods-and-techniques.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1770277296269,"modifiedTime":1770383083375,"sourceSize":11926,"sourcePath":"guides/guiding methods and techniques.md","exportPath":"guides/guiding-methods-and-techniques.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":24,"backlinks":["guides.html","index.html","welcome.html"],"type":"markdown"},"guides/guiding-principles.html":{"title":"guiding principles","icon":"","description":"\n<a data-href=\"principle\" href=\"dictionary/words/principle.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">principle</a>\n/ˈprɪn(t)sɪpl/\nlate Middle English: from Old French, from Latin principium ‘source’, principia (plural) ‘foundations’, from princeps, princip- ‘first, chief’. a rule or belief governing one's behaviour.\nmorally correct behaviour and attitudes.\na fundamental truth or proposition that serves as the foundation for a system of belief or behaviour or for a chain of reasoning.\na fundamental source or basis of something. a fundamental quality determining the nature of something.
