From Latin eruditio&nbsp;("an instructing, learning, erudition"), from erudire&nbsp;("to instruct, educate, cultivate", literally "free from rudeness"), from e&nbsp;("out") + rudis&nbsp;("rude").The word "erudition" comes from the Latin eruditio, meaning "learning," which is a noun from the verb erudire, meaning "to instruct" or "to educate". This Latin verb is a compound of e- ("out") and rudis ("rude," "unskilled," or "rough"), so erudire literally meant "to free from rudeness". Therefore, erudition is the result of being "taken out of a rough or uncultivated state" through a process of education and learning.&nbsp;
Latin roots: erudire = e- ("out") + rudis ("rough," "unskilled").
Literal meaning: "To free from rudeness" or "to remove coarseness".
Figurative meaning: The process of educating or instructing someone, leading them from a state of being "rough" or unlearned to one of polished and extensive knowledge.
Modern usage: The noun "erudition" refers to the deep, scholarly knowledge that results from this process.
